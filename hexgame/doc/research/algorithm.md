# Introduction

The goal of this notes is to sketch the plan to get an AI to play the board game of Hex.

The baseline, which esentially we will to reimplement the "AlphaGo Zero" before experimenting with algorithms that depart from it.

AlphaGo Zero was an algorithm that learn through self-play to play go using reinforcement learning.
